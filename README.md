## Description
 Social networking is a huge part of our day to day lives. There is a lot of data to keep track of, but it all winds up being commonly repeated things like users, their posts, and reactions to their posts. This makes MongoDB an excellent resource for storing all this data. This project is an API backend for such data, using MongoDB.

## Usage
 This is all an api backend, so the user needs a program like Insomnia to interact with it. A walkthrough of these routes can be found here:

## Installation
 Run npm i to install all dependencies. Then start the server by running node index.js. Make sure to have a program like Insomnia to be able to access the routes.
